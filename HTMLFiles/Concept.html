            <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>
            We are facing a critical time. Although the focus on preserving the climate and the globe for future generations is huge,
            we still have a long way to go. There is a great need for environmentally friendly solutions and we wish to make a difference!
            <br>
            <br>
            Denmark is characterized by a flat landscape, which makes cycling a good and environmentally conscious alternative. 15% of all
            trips in Denmark are by bicycle. Despite a lot of cycling, Denmark's ecological footprint is huge, and if all the people in the
            world had the same consumption as an average citizen, we would need 4.2 earths. This shows that the search for environmentally
            friendly solutions is more important than ever, and this are main focus.
            <br>
            <br>
            We have faith in reuse. We want to support the cycling city of Copenhagen by using the technology to make it even easier to buy used
            products. We care about the safety of our consumers and have a lot of love for our city. Re:Cycle fights for an even greener bike
            industry and we hope you do too!
